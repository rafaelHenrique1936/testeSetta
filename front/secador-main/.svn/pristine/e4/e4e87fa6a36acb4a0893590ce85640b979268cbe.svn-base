// This scss source file allows you to customize which modules are compiled into your
// css and which not.
// Please disable all modules that you want to be excluded from your css file,
// but be aware that there are some dependencies, such as icons and buttons.


// DEV Dependencies

// in order to successfully compile these scss files you have to install
// the following additional dev dependencies:
// sass-rem (https://github.com/pierreburel/sass-em)
// breakpoint-sass (https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint)

// You can either install them into your project via npm
// @import "_compass";
// @import "_rem";
// @import "_breakpoint";

// or you can also copy the directories into the appropriate location like this:
//@import "compass-mixins/lib/_compass";
//@import "sass-rem/_rem";
//@import "breakpoint-sass/stylesheets/_breakpoint";


@import "00-settings/color";
@import "00-settings/settings";
@import "00-settings/webfonts_icons";


// if you want to prefix parts or all of the css created by these scss files, you can wrap them
// in a appropriate wrapper below, e.g.
// .mdsp.#someId {
//  insert imports here to prefix them
// }
